# Student-Management-System---AcademiQ
Developed a Django-based student management system with three roles: admin, teacher, and student. Admins can manage user accounts, add/delete teachers, and approve students. Teachers can view student profiles and update their own info. Students can view teacher profiles, edit their details, and log out. Simple, efficient, and user-friendly.
